 This is a Cfx default resource for FiveM servers. Edited with love by Neptunium for Hybrid Networking. Due to Cfx.re's ToS, we will not be advertising this on the FiveM forums. This was created for HNT, but publically released for all to use. Just a dummed down version of bub's [example](https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data/tree/master/resources/%5Btest%5D/example-loadscreen).
